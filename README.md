# TrackPilots API

# Description
TrackPilots API allows you to easily access multiple Pilots tracking data reguardless of which GPS tracker they have, in one easy to use standardized format. All it needs is your name, and tracking link. Pilots can create and join groups so that they can be tracked together using one API call, again reguardless of which device they use.
